        <h2>A Novel Cortical Plate Segmentation Model for High-resolution Fetal Brain MRI</h2>
        <p> Cortical thickness is a crucial feature which reflects various aspects of brain structure and function. 
            In the fetal brain, the measurement of cortical thickness is sensitive to the segmentation of cortical plate (CP), 
            because of the low resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the relatively small brain size. 
            High-resolution MRI data provides detailed delineation of CP enabling accurate cortical thickness measurement.

        <p>   The main objective of the study is to train a new model to segment CP in high-resolution MRIs based on our 
            previous model and a new training dataset.

            Currently, we trained 64 of 116 subjects achieving validation Dice coefficients of 0.946 for sagittal, 0.940 for coronal, and 0.937 for axial view. The visual inspection of the CP segmentation output demonstrates the potential of the high-resolution CP segmentation model (Figure 2). The next step is to correct the segmentation for the remaining data and train the model for final results.
